# Unity_UIHotkeySelect

A basic implementation, intended to be used for simple forms.  

Allows for navigating, selecting and interacting with Unity's UI (input fields; buttons; other selectable elements) with the use of common keyboard hotkeys (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter).  

Includes ability to wrap-around from top-to-bottom / bottom-to-top.
